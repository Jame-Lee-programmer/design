Requisition Form

This is the form that will generate when the "PRINT Requisition" button is pressed.
This is a one (1) page printable form that the client will print and send to the lab with their specimens.
My expectation is that it generates to a new window, in the specified format, ready to right-click and print.
Beautify as you see fit, without loosing the spirit of the form.

Form Layout: REQLayout.rtf (properly formated for WordPad)
Paper Size: 8 1/2" by 11"
Margins: 1/2" on all sides


Header Image: REQHeader.bmp

Barcode Font: Free3OF9.TTF
The barcode will hold a ten (10) digit number.
You must use '*' before and after what you want in the barcode to create a valid barcode.
So, if you want '0123456789' in the barcode, you use '*0123456789*'
The sample REQ.rtf shows this font at 48pt.


Body Font: Courier.
This font is used because it is a monospaced font, making it easy to align columns.
Headers are 14pt and bold.
Other text is 11pt.

Body Text: See REQ.rtf
All database fields are specified in REQ.rtf.

Please note that there are two (2) new columns, Orders.ReqNo and OrderTests.SID.
These fields will be used in the barcodes. ReqNo on this form, and SID in the labels later.


Use these two queries to pull the data for the form:
(changing the OrderID in the WHERE clause)
